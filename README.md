# Angular-Demo-Site
This is the demo site for angular to show what we can do with angular to our potential clients.
In this site we will be doing a bioler plate setup but will be adding video, music, and other types of media just to show that there is still fluid movement and virtually no lag with angular.
We will also set up communications through text entry and possibly video and/or audio communication plugins.
The video aspect we will show that not only prerecorded video can be done, but also livestreeming.
